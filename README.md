This project involves developing an image captioning model using a provided dataset of images and their corresponding captions. This involves splitting the data, selecting appropriate model architectures (such as CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs/LSTMs for caption generation), tuning hyperparameters, preventing overfitting, and evaluating the model with metrics like BLEU, METEOR, or ROUGE. Document your approach and results in a Google Colab notebook and provide a summary report.
